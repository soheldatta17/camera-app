=== 1. Import Modules ===

Import necessary modules and components for the camera, media library, file system, face detector, and React Native elements.

=== 2. CameraScreen Component ===

Create a functional component called `CameraScreen` that represents the camera screen. This component will handle camera operations, face detection, and rendering.

=== 3. State and Refs ===

Initialize state variables and refs using the `useState` and `useRef` hooks. `type` represents the camera type (front or back), and `cameraRef` is a reference to the camera component.

=== 4. Toggle Camera Type ===

Implement the `toggleCameraType` function to switch between front and back camera types.

=== 5. Handle Photo Capture ===

Implement the `handleCapture` function to capture a photo, save it to the camera roll, detect faces, and display a face detection alert.

=== 6. Detect Faces ===

Implement the `detectFaces` function using the FaceDetector module to detect faces in the captured photo.

=== 7. Show Face Detection Alert ===

Implement the `showFaceDetectionAlert` function to display an alert based on the detected faces, including the total number of faces and the number of smiling faces.

=== 8. Render JSX ===

Include JSX code for rendering the Camera component, buttons, and icons within the `CameraScreen` component.

=== 9. App Component ===

Create the main `App` component that handles camera permissions using the `Camera.useCameraPermissions` hook.

=== 10. Permission Check ===

Check if camera permissions are still loading or not granted. Display a message or a button to request permission accordingly.

=== 11. Render CameraScreen ===

If permissions are granted, render the `CameraScreen` component within the main `App` component.

=== 12. Styles ===

Define styles using the `StyleSheet.create` method for the various components, buttons, and camera.
